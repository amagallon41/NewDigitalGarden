# Project 1

# **Turnbull National Wildlife Refuge**
## Client Work

Worked with the Turnbull National Wildlife Refuge outside of Cheney, WA.  The project scope was to visually update the public use map, redesign the the rack card, and create a new flyer layout. The assets were to include TNWRâ€™s branding guidlines to represent a personal and indentifiable look for the Wildlife Refuge. The project took about 4 weeks to complete. Assets were printed and presented to the client at the completion date.
