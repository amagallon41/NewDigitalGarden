# **Project Details**

Worked with the Turnbull National Wildlife Refuge outside of Cheney, WA.  The project scope was to visually update the public use map, redesign the the rack card, and create a new flyer layout. The assets were to include TNWRâ€™s branding guidlines to represent a personal and indentifiable look for the Wildlife Refuge. The project took about 4 weeks to complete. Assets were printed and presented to the client at the completion date.
