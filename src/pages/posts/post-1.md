# **Turnbull National Wildlife Refuge**
## Project Details

Worked with the Turnbull National Wildlife Refuge outside of Cheney, WA.  The project scope was to visually update the public use map, redesign the the rack card, and create a new flyer layout. The assets were to include TNWR’s branding guidlines to represent a personal and indentifiable look for the Wildlife Refuge. The project took about 4 weeks to complete. Assets were printed and presented to the client at the completion date.

# **Women Helping Women Fund**
## Project Details

Women Helping Women Fund is a non-profit organization based in Spokane, WA that holds an annual event in Spokane 
for a charity event. All collaborating organizations come together to host the people of Spokane who are members of the 
Fund. The project was to create two posters that visually represented the theme for the charity event. Collective Giving and 
Give Like A Women were the themes for this year. The WHWF wanted new and exciting posters for the event so members 
can glance at them while they strolled around the venue and donated to their respective organizations. The project lasted for 
3.5 weeks, the posters were then printed and presented to the client.

*Collective Giving*
This poster highlights the importance of giving as a whole. Flowers can’t bloom without care, attention, and most importantly; room to grow. A woman’s face can be seen in the flowers since woman have always been the nurturing and passionate when it comes to taking care of others. Only through collectively working together to grow and prosper will a community thrive to raise its standards to help one another. The quote by Isabell Allende, a Chilean-American writer, tied into the inspiration behind this poster. The women of Mexico and other southern Latin countires face violence and have no choice but to demand changes through protesting and rioting. Here in the United States, women have a voice and are willing to help eachother when asked. This poster represents those women that are willing to lend a hand to help other women grow

*Give Like A Woman*
The poster was inspired by a polaroid. Polaroids are a 1 of 1 copy and memorable moment since the image is printed right in 
front of you. The idea was to compose an image with professional women that were infront of a venue backdrop. Professionalism amongst women is very empowering since issues can be identified and resolved failry quickly. The poster highlights the importance of the event that members and donors would be attending since their money can change the trajectory of ones life.
